## LET'S GET STARTED ON JAVA

Java is a very popular language because of its portability.
The Java language is an object-oriented programming language created by Sun Microsystems employees James Gosling and Patrick Naughton, with support from Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill Joy. Java was officially introduced on May 23, 1995 at SunWorld. The Oracle company then bought the Sun company in 2009, which explains why this language now belongs to Oracle. The particularity and interest of Java lies in its portability between different operating systems such as Unix, Windows, or MacOS. A program developed in Java language can thus be executed on all platforms, thanks to its associated frameworks aimed at guaranteeing this portability.

## LET'S GET STARTED ON JAVA

Java is a very popular language because of its portability.
The Java language is an object-oriented programming language created by Sun Microsystems employees James Gosling and Patrick Naughton, with support from Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill Joy. Java was officially introduced on May 23, 1995 at SunWorld. The Oracle company then bought the Sun company in 2009, which explains why this language now belongs to Oracle. The particularity and interest of Java lies in its portability between different operating systems such as Unix, Windows, or MacOS. A program developed in Java language can thus be executed on all platforms, thanks to its associated frameworks aimed at guaranteeing this portability.

## Discover Object Oriented Programming with NGcodeX

You may have heard the term "object"üòá before in a programming context. But what exactly does that mean?ü§î Let's start by looking at real-world objects, like pens, books, smartphones, computers, etc.

Each type of object comes in different forms   , but you can put them into categories. If you want to buy a chair, you go to a furniture store, to the corresponding section, and you have the choice between several models. They will sometimes be very different from each other, but they will be chairs nonetheless.

You recognize these different objects as part of the same group or type. You notice commonalities between them, collect the information and create a mental representation of that given category of objects.
